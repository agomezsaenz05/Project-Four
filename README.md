## Project Proposal
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns between loan information and loan applicant information. We will attempt to predict loan status based on credit scores as well as examine relationships between income and credit score. We will also look at other related relationships between age, credit score, loan amount and loan status.
- The questions/predictions we will ask of the data:
    1. Predicting loan status based on credit scores?
    2. Relationship between income to credit score?
    3. Relationship between age, credit score, loan amount and status.
