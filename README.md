## Project Proposal
- The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.): 
- The questions you’ll ask of the data:
- Possible source for the data:

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. We’ll examine relationships between transaction types and location, purchase prices and times of day, purchase trends over the course of a year, and other related relationships derived from the data.
