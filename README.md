1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
2. Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
3. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5. You must use at least two of the following:
    - Python Pandas

## Project Proposal
- The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.): Credit score data to predict loan default.
- The questions you’ll ask of the data:
    1. Predicting loan status based on credit scores?
    2. Relationship between income to credit score?
    3. Relationship between age, credit score, loan amount and status.
- Source for the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ychope/loan-approval-dataset

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns between loan information and loan applicant information. We will attempt to predict loan status based on credit scores as well as examine relationships between income and credit score. We will also look at other related relationships between age, credit score, loan amount and loan status.
